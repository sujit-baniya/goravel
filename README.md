Forked https://github.com/goravel/framework
With support to switch between [Gin](https://gin-gonic.com/), [Chi](https://github.com/sujit-baniya/chi) and [GoFiber](https://gofiber.io/) along with following features supported.

## Additional Features
- Switable Routers (Currently Chi, Go-Gonic and Gofiber)
- Support for template engine for views (Currently `html/template` supported)
- Support for static files
- Change in API for context, request and response to support various routers in future.
- Introduction of routes for Web and API including inline middlewares for routes.

## Switch between Chi, Gin or GoFiber
In `config/app.go`, in ServiceProvider list change `route.ServiceProvider` accordingly as

```go
    "providers": []contracts.ServiceProvider{
        ...
			/*&route.ServiceProvider{Engine: fiberRoute.New(fiber.Config{
				Views: view.New("resources/views", ".html"),
			})},*/
			/*&route.ServiceProvider{Engine: ginRoute.New(ginRoute.Config{
				View: view.New("resources/views", ".html"),
			})},*/
			&route.ServiceProvider{Engine: route.NewChi(http.ChiConfig{
				View: view.New("resources/views", ".html"),
			})},
			// &route.ServiceProvider{}, // Default Chi (standard net/http) is used: https://github.com/sujit-baniya/chi
        ...
    },
```
