Forked https://github.com/goravel/framework
With support to switch between [Gin](https://gin-gonic.com/), [Chi](https://github.com/sujit-baniya/chi) and [GoFiber](https://gofiber.io/)

## Switch between Gin or GoFiber
In `config/app.go`, in ServiceProvider list change `route.ServiceProvider` accordingly as

```go
    "providers": []contracts.ServiceProvider{
        ...
		// &route.ServiceProvider{Engine: route.NewFiber()},
		// &route.ServiceProvider{Engine: route.NewGin()},
		// &route.ServiceProvider{Engine: route.NewChi()},
		&route.ServiceProvider{}, // Default Chi (standard net/http) is used: https://github.com/sujit-baniya/chi
        ...
    },
```
